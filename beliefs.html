    <h5>Denominational Affiliation</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">While non-denominational in its approach to ministry, New Heart Foursquare Church
      is a part of <br> the Foursquare denomination. If you want to learn more about Foursquare, you can visit<br>
      Foursquare's website by clicking <b><a href="https://www.foursquare.org/">here</a></b>.</p><br>

      <h5>What is Foursquare?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        The name represents the four-fold ministries of Jesus:
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>The Savior</u>
        <br>
        "But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement <br>for
        our peace was upon Him..." <br> Isaiah 53:5 (Titus 2:14, Isaiah 55:7, Hebrews 7:25, Isaiah 1:18)<br>


        <br>
        <u>The Baptizer with the Holy Spirit</u><br>
        <br>"For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit...
        you shall <br>receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses
        to Me in <br>Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<br>
        Acts 1:5, 8 (John 14:16-17, Acts 2:4, Acts 8:17, Acts 10:44-46, 1 Corinthians 3:16)<br>

        <br>
        <u>The Healer</u><br>
        "He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses..."  Matthew 8:17
        <br>(Mark 16:17-18, Matthew 9:5-6, Acts 4:29-30)<br>

        <br>
        <u>The Soon-Coming King</u><br>
        "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout... the dead in Christ will rise first. <br>
        Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet<br>the
        Lord in the air.  And thus we shall always be with the Lord." <br> 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
        (Titus 2:12-13, Matthew 24:36-44, Hebrews 9:28, Luke 19:13, <br>Luke 12:35-37.)
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>What are the beliefs of the Foursquare Church?</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          <u>Salvation</u><br>

          <br><i>The Fall of Man</i>: We believe that Adam and Eve, the precursors of the entire human race, were <br>created
          in the image of God; however, they disobeyed God and became sinners.  Through Adam, <br>all people
          inherited sin’s nature and consequences, and all are in need of a Redeemer.<br> (Genesis 1:27; Romans 5:12, 19)<br>

          <br>
          <i>The Plan of Redemption</i>: We believe that Christ died for all of us while we were still sinners;
          He <br>took the punishment for our sin.  With His own blood, He purchased salvation and redemption<br>
          for all who believe in Him. <br>(John 3:16; Isaiah 53:5; Titus 2:14)
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Salvation Through Grace</i>: We believe that salvation is totally an act of God’s grace that is <br>accessed
          through faith in Jesus Christ.  No person can be good enough to earn salvation, and <br>“being good” does not
          contribute to receiving God’s love and favor. <br>(Ephesians 2:8, 13)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Repentance & Acceptance</i>: We believe that, when people repent for their sins and accept Christ,<br> they are
          justified through Jesus’ sacrificial death on the cross.  To repent means to be sorry for <br>sins, but it also
          means to turn away from a sinful lifestyle.  Accepting Christ means believing <br>in Him as the only Savior.
          To be justified means being declared “not guilty” in regard to sin. <br>(Romans 10:9-10; 1 John 1:9)<br>
          <br>
          <i>The New Birth</i>: We believe that the change that takes place in people when they are “born again” <br>is very real.
          They receive righteousness through Jesus Christ, and they are empowered by the<br> Holy Spirit; therefore, they
          should have new desires, interests and pursuits.<br>(John 3:3; 2 Corinthians 5:17)<br>

          <br><u>The Christian Walk</u>
          <br>
          <br><i>Daily Christian Life</i>: We believe that people who have been born again grow in sanctification—<br>which means
          they separate themselves from the value system of the world and embrace and live <br> to the values
          of the kingdom that Jesus proclaimed.  As they do so, they increase in holiness, <br>faith,power, prayer, love
          and service. <br>(2 Corinthians 7:1)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Evangelism</i>: We believe that evangelizing and making disciples is the primary “business” of the <br>church; every
          hindrance to worldwide evangelism should be removed. <br>(James 5:20; Mark 16:15)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Tithing & Offerings</i>: We believe that tithing (giving 10 percent of earnings) and offerings (amounts <br>determined
          by the individuals) are God’s instruments to carry on His ministry, spread the gospel,<br> and release personal
          blessing.<br> (Malachi 3:10; 1 Corinthians 16:1, 2)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Moderation</i>: We believe that Christians should avoid excess and that their moderation should be <br>obvious to others.
          Their commitment to Christ should be deep and sincere, but they should not <br>indulge in or lead other people into
          extremes of fanaticism.  Christians should be well thought of, <br>balanced, humble and self-sacrificing, reflecting
          Christ’s grace and character in all areas of their <br>lives. <br>(Colossians 3:12, 13; Philippians 4:5)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Church Relationship</i>: We believe that it is essential for all believers to join with and become<br> part of a
          congregation of other believers.  It is important to worship together, observe the <br>ordinances of the church,
          encourage and support one another, and work together to advance the <br>Lord’s kingdom. <br>(Hebrews 10:24, 25)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Civil Government</i>: We believe that civil government is established by divine appointment; civil <br>laws should
          be upheld at all times except when they are in opposition to the Word of God. <br>(Romans 13:1-7)<br>
          <br>
          <i>The Spirit-Filled Life</i>
          The Holy Scriptures: We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of <br>God; it is absolutely true, enduring,
           and unchangeable.<br> (2 Timothy 3:16, 17. Matthew 24:35)<br>
          <br>
          <i>The Eternal Godhead</i>: We believe in the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God <br>the Holy Spirit.
          The three parts of the Trinity are coexistent and co-eternal, which means that <br>they always have existed
          and always will exist together; they are coequal in divine perfection, <br>which means that no person of the
          Trinity is more powerful or more perfect than any other <br>person in the Trinity.<br> (1 John 5:7)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Water Baptism & the Lord's Supper</i>: We believe that people who have been born again should be <br>baptized in
          the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  Jesus Himself was baptized and <br>instructed His followers
          to be baptized.  Baptism also confirms that Christ is the Lord and King in<br> each believer’s life (Romans 6:4).
          We believe in observing the Lord’s supper, or communion,<br> just as Jesus instructed.  This means that born-again
          believers take the broken bread and the fruit <br>of the vine as a remembrance and celebration of the new life that
          is theirs because of Jesus’ <br>death on the cross and His resurrection.  It is also looking forward to His return
          as triumphant King. <br>(1 Corinthians 11:24-26)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Baptism with the Holy Spirit</i>: We believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience <br>that follows
          salvation.  All believers have God’s Spirit within them. Holy Spirit baptism empowers <br>believers to exalt Jesus,
          to live lives of holiness, and to be witnesses of God’s saving grace.  We <br>believe that those who experience
          Holy Spirit baptism today will experience it in the same manner <br>that believers experienced it in the early
          church; in other words, we believe that they will speak in <br>tongues—languages that are not known to them.
          <br>(Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Divine Healing</i>: We believe that Jesus Christ heals people who are sick.  God does not change; He<br> is still
          willing and able to heal the body, as well as the soul and spirit, in response to faith.
          <br>(Mark 16:17, 18; James 5:14-16)<br>
          <br>
          <i>The Spirit-Filled Life</i>: We believe that born-again believers should be people who pray and who <br>allow the Holy
          Spirit to shape their values and behaviors every day; their lives should exemplify <br>love, honesty and sincerity.
          <br>(Ephesians 4:30-32)<br>
          <br>
          <i>The Gifts & Fruit of the Spirit</i>: We believe that the Holy Spirit gives ministry gifts to believers;<br> in other
          words, the Holy Spirit gives people special abilities for ministry.  These gifts will <br>build up groups of
          believers and help them mature in Christian faith. <br>(1 Corinthians 12:1-11) <br><br>Further, Spirit-filled believers
          should show the spiritual “fruit” that has been given to them: love, <br>joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
          faith, gentleness, self-control.<br> (Romans 12:6-8; Galatians 5:22-25)<br>
          <br>
          <br><u>The Afterlife</u><br>
          <br><i>The Second Coming of Christ</i>: We believe that the second coming of Christ is personal and <br>imminent; we are as
          certain that His second coming will occur as we are that His first coming<br> is a historical fact.  No one knows
          the exact time of His coming, but believers will continue to <br>spread the gospel around the world until He does
          come again.  At that time the Lord Himself will <br>descend from heaven, the dead Christians will be resurrected,
          and believers will be taken up to <br>meet the Lord in the air. <br>(Matthew 24:36, 42, 44; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Judgment</i>: We believe that everyone will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  Born-again<br> believers will be
          sent to a place of everlasting life, and nonbelievers will be sent to a place of <br>everlasting punishment.<br>
          (Revelation 20:11, 12; 2 Corinthians 5:10)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Heaven</i>: We believe that heaven is the habitation of the living God and the eternal home of <br>born-again believers.
          <br>(John 14:2; Revelation 7:15-17)<br>
          <br>
          <i>Hell</i>: We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deep sorrow and unquenchable fire, which was <br>not prepared
          for man but for the devil and his angels; it will become the place of eternal separation<br> from God for all who
          reject Christ as Savior. <br>(Matthew 13:41, 42; Revelation 20:10, 15)<br>
