    <h5>Denominational Affiliation</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">While non-denominational in its approach to ministry, New Heart Foursquare Church
      is a part of the Foursquare denomination.<br>  If you want to learn more about Foursquare, you can visit

      <h5>What is Foursquare?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        The name represents the four-fold ministries of Jesus:
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>The Savior</u>
        <br>
        "But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for
        our peace was upon Him..." <br> Isaiah 53:5 (Titus 2:14, Isaiah 55:7, Hebrews 7:25, Isaiah 1:18)<br>


        <br>
        <u>The Baptizer with the Holy Spirit</u><br>
        <br>"For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit...
        you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit <br>has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses
        to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<br>
        Acts 1:5, 8 (John 14:16-17, Acts 2:4, Acts 8:17, Acts 10:44-46, 1 Corinthians 3:16)<br>

        <br>
        <u>The Healer</u><br>

        <br>(Mark 16:17-18, Matthew 9:5-6, Acts 4:29-30)<br>

        <br>
        <u>The Soon-Coming King</u><br>
        "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout... the dead in Christ will rise first.
        Then we who are alive <br>and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the
        Lord in the air.  And thus we shall always be with the Lord." <br> 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
        (Titus 2:12-13, Matthew 24:36-44, Hebrews 9:28, Luke 19:13, Luke 12:35-37.)

        <br>
        <h5>What are the beliefs of the Foursquare Church?</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          <u>Salvation</u><br>

          <br><i>The Fall of Man</i>: We believe that Adam and Eve, the precursors of the entire human race, were created
          in the image of God; <br>however, they disobeyed God and became sinners.  Through Adam, all people
          inherited sin’s nature and consequences, <br> and all are in need of a Redeemer (Genesis 1:27; Romans 5:12, 19).<br>

          <br>
          <i>The Plan of Redemption</i>: We believe that Christ died for all of us while we were still sinners;
          He took the punishment for <br>our sin.  With His own blood, He purchased salvation and redemption
          for all who believe in Him (John 3:16; Isaiah 53:5; Titus 2:14).

          Salvation Through Grace: We believe that salvation is totally an act of God’s grace that is accessed
          through faith in Jesus Christ.  No person can be good enough to earn salvation, and “being good” does not
          contribute to receiving God’s love and favor (Ephesians 2:8, 13).

          Repentance & Acceptance: We believe that, when people repent for their sins and accept Christ, they are
          justified through Jesus’ sacrificial death on the cross.  To repent means to be sorry for sins, but it also
          means to turn away from a sinful lifestyle.  Accepting Christ means believing in Him as the only Savior.
          To be justified means being declared “not guilty” in regard to sin (Romans 10:9-10; 1 John 1:9).

          The New Birth: We believe that the change that takes place in people when they are “born again” is very real.
          They receive righteousness through Jesus Christ, and they are empowered by the Holy Spirit; therefore, they
          should have new desires, interests and pursuits (John 3:3; 2 Corinthians 5:17).


          <u>The Christian Walk</u>

          Daily Christian Life: We believe that people who have been born again grow in sanctification—which means
          they separate themselves from the value system of the world and embrace and live according to the values
          of the kingdom that Jesus proclaimed.  As they do so, they increase in holiness, faith, power, prayer, love
          and service (2 Corinthians 7:1).

          Evangelism: We believe that evangelizing and making disciples is the primary “business” of the church; every
          hindrance to worldwide evangelism should be removed (James 5:20; Mark 16:15).

          Tithing & Offerings: We believe that tithing (giving 10 percent of earnings) and offerings (amounts determined
          by the individuals) are God’s instruments to carry on His ministry, spread the gospel, and release personal
          blessing (Malachi 3:10; 1 Corinthians 16:1, 2).

          Moderation: We believe that Christians should avoid excess and that their moderation should be obvious to others.
          Their commitment to Christ should be deep and sincere, but they should not indulge in or lead other people into
          extremes of fanaticism.  Christians should be well thought of, balanced, humble and self-sacrificing, reflecting
          Christ’s grace and character in all areas of their lives (Colossians 3:12, 13; Philippians 4:5).

          Church Relationship: We believe that it is essential for all believers to join with and become part of a
          congregation of other believers.  It is important to worship together, observe the ordinances of the church,
          encourage and support one another, and work together to advance the Lord’s kingdom (Hebrews 10:24, 25).

          Civil Government: We believe that civil government is established by divine appointment; civil laws should
          be upheld at all times except when they are in opposition to the Word of God (Romans 13:1-7).

          The Spirit-Filled Life
          The Holy Scriptures: We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God; it is absolutely true, enduring,
           and unchangeable (2 Timothy 3:16, 17. Matthew 24:35).

          The Eternal Godhead: We believe in the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.
          The three parts of the Trinity are coexistent and co-eternal, which means that they always have existed
          and always will exist together; they are coequal in divine perfection, which means that no person of the
          Trinity is more powerful or more perfect than any other person in the Trinity (1 John 5:7).

          Water Baptism & the Lord's Supper: We believe that people who have been born again should be baptized in
          the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  Jesus Himself was baptized and instructed His followers
          to be baptized.  Baptism also confirms that Christ is the Lord and King in each believer’s life (Romans 6:4).
          We believe in observing the Lord’s supper, or communion, just as Jesus instructed.  This means that born-again
          believers take the broken bread and the fruit of the vine as a remembrance and celebration of the new life that
          is theirs because of Jesus’ death on the cross and His resurrection.  It is also looking forward to His return
          as triumphant King (1 Corinthians 11:24-26).

          Baptism with the Holy Spirit: We believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience that follows
          salvation.  All believers have God’s Spirit within them. Holy Spirit baptism empowers believers to exalt Jesus,
          to live lives of holiness, and to be witnesses of God’s saving grace.  We believe that those who experience
          Holy Spirit baptism today will experience it in the same manner that believers experienced it in the early
          church; in other words, we believe that they will speak in tongues—languages that are not known to them
          (Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4).

          Divine Healing: We believe that Jesus Christ heals people who are sick.  God does not change; He is still
          willing and able to heal the body, as well as the soul and spirit, in response to faith
          (Mark 16:17, 18; James 5:14-16).

          The Spirit-Filled Life: We believe that born-again believers should be people who pray and who allow the Holy
          Spirit to shape their values and behaviors every day; their lives should exemplify love, honesty and sincerity
          (Ephesians 4:30-32).

          The Gifts & Fruit of the Spirit: We believe that the Holy Spirit gives ministry gifts to believers; in other
          words, the Holy Spirit gives people special abilities for ministry.  These gifts will build up groups of
          believers and help them mature in Christian faith (1 Corinthians 12:1-11).  Further, Spirit-filled believers
          should show the spiritual “fruit” that has been given to them: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
          faith, gentleness, self-control (Romans 12:6-8; Galatians 5:22-25).

          <u>The Afterlife</u>
          The Second Coming of Christ: We believe that the second coming of Christ is personal and imminent; we are as
          certain that His second coming will occur as we are that His first coming is a historical fact.  No one knows
          the exact time of His coming, but believers will continue to spread the gospel around the world until He does
          come again.  At that time the Lord Himself will descend from heaven, the dead Christians will be resurrected,
          and believers will be taken up to meet the Lord in the air (Matthew 24:36, 42, 44; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17).

          Judgment: We believe that everyone will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  Born-again believers will be
          sent to a place of everlasting life, and nonbelievers will be sent to a place of everlasting punishment
          (Revelation 20:11, 12; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

          Heaven: We believe that heaven is the habitation of the living God and the eternal home of born-again believers
          (John 14:2; Revelation 7:15-17).

          Hell: We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deep sorrow and unquenchable fire, which was not prepared
          for man but for the devil and his angels; it will become the place of eternal separation from God for all who
          reject Christ as Savior (Matthew 13:41, 42; Revelation 20:10, 15).
