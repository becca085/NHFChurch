        <br>
        <p class="w3-large">
          Pastor Chuck and Marianne have been in full-time ministry for 30 years.  They met in 1983 when he was
          a sales representative for Johnson & Johnson, and she was a sales representative for Sony.  They fell
          in love and dated for 10 weeks.  They got married in 1983, and their son Charles was born a year later.
          Pastor Chuck loves people and thrives on seeing them serve the Lord with gladness.  He desires to see
          the Holy Spirit move in the services and in people's lives for transformation and healing.  After
          Pastor Chuck had been in ministry for 20 years, God opened the door for him to be the Senior Pastor
          at New Heart Foursquare Church, where he has served for the last 12 years.  Pastor Chuck holds his
          Bachelor of Arts degree from Cal State Long Beach and a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Leadership
          from Life Pacific College.

          Marianne is developing various ministries at New Heart, and works as a Recruitment Consultant for a
          major health care agency in Southern California. She holds her Bachelor of Science degree from Azusa
          Pacific University.

        <br>
        <p class="w3-large">
          Charlie serves at New Heart Foursquare Church as a pastor and organizer of our men's ministry program
          called the King's Men Ministry.

          He also assists Pastor Chuck with communion, leads Bible studies, and previously volunteered with his wife
          Jeanne in the hospitality ministry. Charlie is originally from Beeville, Texas, and he grew up on a farm.
          He later joined the U.S. Navy and was awarded several good conduct and service medals for his service during
          Vietnam.  Charlie also obtained the rank of petty officer and received an honorable discharge.

          After leaving the Navy, Charlie gained 45 years of maintenance experience in the electrical, mechanical,
          pneumatics, hydraulics, and electronics fields for 4 different companies in Southern California.  He has
          previous experience at other churches in the Inland Empire as President of the Board of Trustees, member
          of the Finance Committee, deacon, and leader of a junior high group.  Charlie came to New Heart Foursquare
          Church when he married his wife Jeanne, and he recently retired to fulfill his dream of travelling across
          the United States.

          Charlie enjoys that the Holy Spirit is alive and well at New Heart Foursquare Church, believes that the
          congregation is led by a pastor who loves the Lord and preaches directly from Scripture, and attests that
          the church exhibits a genuinely loving spirit.  His desire is to lead and encourage the men in the church
          to become more involved in serving the body of Christ and to help them grow in the Lord, just as he has
           grown spiritually during his time at New Heart.

        <p class="w3-large">
          Margaret has been a Christian since she was 15 years old.  Her grandparents took her to
          church and prayed for her while she was growing up.  She went with her friend to the
          Baptist church and attended a high school winter camp.  When the altar call was given,
          she didn't know she was supposed to ask Christ into her heart.  Once she realized this,
          she wanted to make it public in front of everyone, so she did.  Today, she serves the
            Lord by ministering to the children of New Heart and by teaching them the Word of God.

          Professionally, Margaret taught for 32 years in the Mountain View school district of El Monte,
           California.  God used her to present Christmas plays, so the children and families could hear
           about the Lord.  She attended Cal State Long Beach for her Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies
           and for her teaching credential. Margaret also received her Masters in Education with a reading
           credential from Cal Poly Pomona.  She still likes to help children learn if they have a learning
           disability.

           As the Lord fills Margaret with His spirit, she continues to work with children and is open to
           the Lord's leading as she ministers in song.  She is married to her husband Mando, and has four
           adult children.

      <br>
      <p class="w3-large">
        Rosie comes from a Christian background since childhood.  As a young teenager,
        she was involved in the church choir and was also a part of a young girl's praise
        and worship team.  Recently, she served in the usher, choir, tape, and phone prayer
        ministries.  At New Heart Foursquare Church, she currently serves in the praise and
        worship team, the hospitality team, and the children's ministry.

        As our Ministry Liaison, Rosie assists Pastor Chuck & Marianne with special events
        and projects at the church, and she brings people with her wherever she goes.  She
        also started a very successful Bible study at her work during lunchtime, igniting
        spiritual growth in the lives of many of her co-workers.  Her goal is to succeed
        spiritually and to continue to reach out and minister to friends, family, and anyone
        she meets out in the street.
